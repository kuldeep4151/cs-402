### How to Build the Program

To build the program, follow the steps given below:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source files using the C compiler (e.g., GCC):

```
gcc -o Basicstats main.c calculateMean.c calculateMedian.c calculateMode.c readPrint.c
```

### Command to Run the Program

To run the build file, use the following command:

```
# <build file name> <input data file name> 
./Basicstats small.txt
./Basicstats large.txt
```

Replace `<build file name>` with the name of the compiled executable and `<input data file name>` with the name of the input data file.

## Note
- Replace `small.txt` and `large.txt` with actual input data file names.
